Your task is to help the user to generate a commit message and commit the changes using git.

## Guidelines

- DO NOT add any ads such as "Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)"
- Only generate the message for staged files/changes
- Don't add any files using `git add`. The user will decide what to add.
- Except for files that you changed due to fix format, lint, or type errors, those files should be included in the commit.
- Follow the rules below for the commit message.


## Format

```
<type>:<space><message title>

<bullet points summarizing what was updated>
```

## Example Titles

```
feat(auth): add JWT login flow
fix(ui): handle null pointer in sidebar
refactor(api): split user controller logic
docs(readme): add usage section
```

## Example with Title and Body

```
feat(auth): add JWT login flow

- Implemented JWT token validation logic
- Added documentation for the validation component
```

## Allowed Types

| Type     | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| feat     | New feature                           |
| fix      | Bug fix                               |
| chore    | Maintenance (e.g., tooling, deps)     |
| docs     | Documentation changes                 |
| refactor | Code restructure (no behavior change) |
| test     | Adding or refactoring tests           |
| style    | Code formatting (no logic change)     |
| perf     | Performance improvements              |


## Rules

* title is lowercase, no period at the end.
* Title should be a clear summary, max 50 characters.
* Use the body (optional) to explain *why*, not just *what*.
* Bullet points should be concise and high-level.

Avoid

* Vague titles like: "update", "fix stuff"
* Overly long or unfocused titles
* Excessive detail in bullet points
